Piculet is a module for extracting data from XML or HTML documents
using XPath queries.
It consists of a `single source file`_ with no dependencies other than
the standard library, which makes it very easy to integrate into applications.
It also provides a command line interface.

Getting started
---------------

Piculet has been tested with Python 3.5+ and PyPy 3.6.
You can install the latest version using ``pip``::

    pip install piculet

Installing Piculet creates a script named ``piculet`` which can be used
to invoke the command line interface::

   $Â piculet -h
   usage: piculet [-h] [--version] [--html] (-s SPEC | --h2x)

For example, say you want to extract some data from the file `shining.html`_.
An example specification is given in `movie.json`_.
Download both of these files and run the command::

   $ cat shining.html | piculet -s movie.json
