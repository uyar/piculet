Piculet is a module for extracting data from XML or HTML documents
using XPath queries.
It consists of a `single source file`_ with no dependencies
other than the standard library,
which makes it very easy to integrate into applications.

.. note::

   In Python 3.7-3.9, it requires the `typing_extensions` module.

Piculet also provides a command line interface.

Piculet is used for the parsers
of the `IMDbPY <https://github.com/alberanid/imdbpy>`_ project.

Getting started
---------------

Piculet works with Python 3.7 and later versions.
You can install it using ``pip``::

    pip install piculet

Installing Piculet creates a script named ``piculet`` which can be used
to invoke the command line interface::

   $Â piculet -h
   usage: piculet [-h] [--version] [--html] -s SPEC

For example, say you want to extract some data from the file `shining.html`_.
An example specification is given in `movie.json`_.
Download both of these files and run the command::

   $ cat shining.html | piculet -s movie.json

.. _shining.html: https://github.com/uyar/piculet/blob/master/examples/shining.html
.. _movie.json: https://github.com/uyar/piculet/blob/master/examples/movie.json
