Getting started
---------------

Piculet works with Python 3.7 and later versions.
You can install it using ``pip``::

    pip install piculet

Installing Piculet creates a script named ``piculet``
which can be used to invoke the command line interface::

   $Â piculet -h
   usage: piculet [-h] [--version] [--html] -s SPEC [document]

For example, say you want to extract some data from the file `shining.html`_.
An example specification is given in `movie.json`_.
Download both of these files and run the command::

   $ piculet -s movie.json shining.html
